# Chennai House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in Chennai, India, using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other amenities of houses in Chennai.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "chennai_house_prices.csv" dataset, which includes information about house properties and their corresponding prices. It contains features such as location, total square feet area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices in Chennai based on the available features. The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: This step involves exploring the dataset, understanding the features, and handling any missing or inconsistent data. Data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering may also be performed to prepare the data for model training.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, we will analyze the existing features and create new features that can potentially improve the predictive power of the model. This may include transforming categorical variables, encoding location information, or extracting relevant features from text descriptions.

3. **Model Selection and Training**: Various regression algorithms will be evaluated and compared to select the best model for this task. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the chosen model will be trained using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and accuracy. This step will help in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and predicts house prices in Chennai.

5. **Price Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict house prices for new properties in Chennai by providing the relevant features as input.
